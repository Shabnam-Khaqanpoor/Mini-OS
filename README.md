# Mini OS

##  Operating System File System Simulation

Mini OS is a **file system simulation** implemented in Python, providing functionalities for file creation, deletion, renaming, compression, scheduling, and directory management. It simulates a **FAT-based** file system with **block-based storage**, including disk formatting and metadata management.

---

##  Features

 **Virtual Disk Management** with block-based allocation\
 **File Operations**: Create, delete, rename, read, and execute files\
 **Directory Management**: Create, remove, and navigate directories\
 **Compression & Decompression** using **zlib**\
 **File Scheduling**: Execute files after a time delay\
 **Storage Management**: Check disk usage and available space\
 **Command Logging** for auditing user actions
